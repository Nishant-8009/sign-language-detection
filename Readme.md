# Sign Language Detection

## Overview

The Sign Language Detection project aims to recognize and interpret sign language gestures through computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project utilizes the Mediapipe library to identify and track key landmarks on the face, hands, and pose, enabling the detection of sign language movements in real-time.

## Project Features

- **Landmark Detection**: Uses Mediapipe's holistic model to detect and track facial, hand, and body landmarks in images or video streams.
- **Keypoint Extraction**: Extracts relevant keypoints from detected landmarks to serve as inputs for gesture recognition models.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Employs neural network models to classify and recognize sign language gestures based on the extracted keypoints.

## Technologies and Algorithms

- **Mediapipe**: Utilized for holistic landmark detection, providing robust tracking of facial features, hand joints, and body pose. Mediapipe simplifies the process of capturing and processing video data for landmark recognition.
  - **Face Landmarks**: Detects and tracks facial landmarks to understand expressions and movements.
  - **Hand Landmarks**: Identifies hand positions and gestures by tracking keypoints on each hand.
  - **Pose Landmarks**: Tracks body posture and movements through key body joints.
  
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing, including color conversion and drawing landmarks on frames to visualize the detected features.
- **NumPy**: Facilitates efficient manipulation and processing of numerical data, particularly for handling arrays of keypoints.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks are trained to recognize and classify gestures based on the extracted keypoints. The model leverages the spatial relationships among the landmarks to interpret sign language.

## Project Workflow

1. **Input Processing**: Images or video frames are processed to detect and track landmarks using Mediapipe's holistic model.
2. **Landmark Visualization**: The detected landmarks are drawn on the input images for visual verification and debugging.
3. **Keypoint Extraction**: Key points from face, hand, and pose landmarks are extracted and flattened into a feature vector.
4. **Gesture Classification**: The feature vector is fed into a neural network model that classifies the input into predefined sign language gestures.
5. **Output Interpretation**: The classified gesture is displayed or processed further to understand the sign language being performed.
